# Computer Organisation and Architecture Term Project
Designed a Smart Air Conditioner which is a 16-bit machine.

## Assembler Design
1. Written a C program which will convert the mnemonic code of our Smart AC to its equivalent binary machine code.
2. Tested our assembler for a specific scenario. 

## Machine Simulation

1. Written a C program to implement the designed ISA as a computing machine which takes binary machine instructions as an input and produces the final output. 
2. Displayed status of registers, ALU control signals and flag register for each instruction execution.
